            <strong>Many years ago...</strong> <br /><br />
            I studied History at the <i>University of Essex</i> but I couldn't stay still. I moved to <i>Prague</i> for one year during my studies and fell so
            in love with my time there that it was quite hard to bring my feet back to British soil in order to finish the last year of my degree.<br />
            I soon went back on the run however and moved to <i>Amsterdam</i> where I worked as an Au Pair by day and explored by night. But something
            wasn't quite right so I joined my friends in <i>Paris</i> where I ended up living for 3 years.<br />
            I met a professor there, whilst working for the <a href="https://eefb.org/">East European Film Bulletin</a>, who runs a film restoration course in <i>Berlin</i> and I was convinced this would be my next step.<br />
            Before long I had interviewed for a place and got in 😍.<br />
            💚<br />
            💛<br />
            💔<br />
            But the HTW broke my heart when, with little notice before the start of the school year, they made a change to the language
            requirements needed to enroll. I unsurprisingly failed their last minute B2 German exam and quickly had to come up with a plan B for my life in Germany.<br />
            So I worked as a Customer Service Team Leader of 30 fantastic agents for a while before finding the <a href="https://digitalcareerinstitute.org/courses/web-development-course">Web Development Course at the DCI</a> and securing my place on a path that I am really excited to walk down.
